- error messages are not great.
  - should check if the necessary cert files are present before using
    them so I can print out a more meaningful error message

- possibly handle half-closes

- possibly handle asynchronous ssl handshakes

- XXX Big bug!
  - it looks like the SSL connection proxying is not working properly
  - try --ssl-in but not -ssl-out,  using netcat as the listener
    and openssl s_client as the connector
    - at first the netcat's output gets sent
    - after the openssl client types something, the netcat side
      cant seem to send anything anymore!  but its still selecting!
    - the openssl sender stuff doesnt get passed on to netcat until
      one select later..  
  some of this sounds like its my fault, but some of it sounds
  potentially like a python issue..  needs more investigation!
